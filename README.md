## Requirements
- python
- pywal
- fzf
- ripgrep
- pandoc
- latex
- zathura
- some [nerd font](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts) for icons

## Install
Make sure you have the neovim 0.7.0+ installed.  
Note that neovim 0.8 breaks my config for some reason.  

Clone this under your ~/.config/nvim directory

```
git clone https://github.com/AsianKoala/nvim.git ~/.config/nvim
```

Then run `nvim` and `:PackerInstall` to set everything up.
